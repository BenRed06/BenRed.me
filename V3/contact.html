<h2 align="center"> About</h2>

<p>Im from suburban Massachusetts but spend a lot of my time in the mountains of new hampshire. Im a freshman in highschool and get decent grades. I like to code. I make discord bots for fun. I have a few verified bots. these include: the office triva, Dad Jokes and coming soon Alt List. I recently started learning HTML and CSS and want to learn other coding languages. any help you can give on coding is greatly appreciated! I love to fly. ever sinvr I was a very young kid I have wanted to be a pilot. I will never forget the moment I decided I was going to be a pilot. we are flying home from florida and right as we touched down in boston and the air brakes (the slats on the wings that go vertical on landing) going up I turned to my dad and said "I want to be pilot" through the years my love of aviation has diminished but I still love fight sims and hope to one day be a navy C-130 pilot.</p>
